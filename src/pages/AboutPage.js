      <AboutSection svgStyle="chessSVG" year="1995 - 2005" style={svgStyle}>
        Iâ€™ve always loved solving problems and thinking strategically. Growing up, I played chess for England.

      <AboutSection svgStyle="mathSVG" rowStyle="flex-row-reverse" year="2006 - 2011" style={svgStyle}>
        I studied Maths, Physics and Electronics at college, followed by Maths at Leeds University. Logical thinking has always come naturally to me.

      <AboutSection svgStyle="pokerSVG" year="2011 - 2013" style={svgStyle}>
        Being a bit of a rebel and a know-it-all, I dropped out of Uni to play online poker for a living. It went well unti the market became saturated, players got tougher, and the government cracked down (heavy regulations and high taxes).

      <AboutSection svgStyle="accountingSVG" rowStyle="flex-row-reverse" year="2013 - 2021" style={svgStyle}>
        It was time to find a 9-5. Zero work experience on my CV didn't help. I started off by volunteering at a local charity in the accounts department. From there I gained experience and eventually decided I may as well get my "piece of paper". I started training to become a CIMA qualified management accountant in 2017 and qualified in 2021.

        If you take a peek at my Github profile, you'll see that I signed up in 2013. Back in those days I was still learning HTML &amp; CSS, whilst following Ruby on Rails zombie app tutorials on Code Academy. I dabbled around, coding on and off over the years. It's now 2021 and I've decided to take coding more seriously. In September I committed to making at least one Github commit every day for a year.

      <AboutSection svgStyle="futureSVG" rowStyle="flex-row-reverse" year="Future Me" style={svgStyle}>
        Right now I'm working on my React skills. I do enjoy working with databases and in the future I'd like to work on more backend projects. I particularly like Strapi at the moment. I enjoy UI/UX design so I may specialise in this a bit further as well.
